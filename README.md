# Reporting Dashboard for MO &amp; ITP 

##Usage
1. Set up the database and host server
2. Import tables from the sql file in the same format (file is not provided due to confidetiality of the file content)
3. Once configured the main page index.php should load.

(if the data_retrival.php throws an error, there is most likely a problem with your sql/table configuration)
